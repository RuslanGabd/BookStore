Task 1 (difficulty 10)

Modify the application from previous tasks to a web application.

Task requirements:

For implementation use Spring MVC;

Add DTO (Data transfer objects) to the project to describe controller responses;

Responses to requests must be in JSON and/or XML format;

The application must have a REST architecture (use the Postman tool for verification);

All the requirements for the functionality of the application must be available in the controllers;

Processing and issuing exceptions to the user should be implemented using @ExceptionHandler and @Controlleradvice;

Rewrite previously implemented work with transactions via Hibernate to use the @Transactional annotation in the service layer;

Build the application in WAR and deploy it on Tomcat or Jetty.
