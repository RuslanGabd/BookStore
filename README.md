# TASK 8.2

## BookStore
Task 2 (difficulty 10)

Develop a set of annotations and a separate module for their processing:

The module should allow dependency injections (DI) in the program modules. An object containing annotated fields should be submitted to the input, and the module should implement dependencies in them.

To organize low coupling between modules of the application developed in previous tasks. For implementation, it is necessary to use the Dependency injection pattern and the Reflection mechanism. All application modules must be changed to this solution.
